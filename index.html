              <p>When you go organic you’re paying for a new lifestyle. Genetically modified foods are marketed as less expensive because they’re produced in bulk and cost less to grow. With Plant, however, we guarantee you’re getting a bang for your buck with less chemicals and preservatives. Plant recommends you buy organic because this would mean less exposure to chemicals, pesticides and consequently a lesser change of getting cancer or any sort of health problems in the future. In the last decade, with the change in the value of money, the value of produce and necessities have increased significantly. Plant has made it a priority to bring healthy, non-GMO, chemical free produce to all stores by 2025.</p>

              <p>Agriculture has been modified for decades, however the means of how food is being tampered with is becoming more and more dangerous to consumers. New sciences and research have not fully grasped the impact on genetically modified foods on the human body, but are still deploying a large amount of GMO foods to shelves. In early farming, we see farmers cross breed selective fruits and vegetables in order to modify food size, colour, or shape. However, one thing is undeniable, people are consuming meals made from ingredients that may not be safe for their health. While there is evidence of GMO-foods being good for mass food production, science has failed in deducting the ways in which the health of people might be effected. </p>

              <p>In the year 2100, we can expect populations so soar past our wildest expectations. With a global crisis in food shortages with the current world population of 7 billion, the future will certainly be challenging. Plant’s goal is for the long term. We are aiming to solve the current food shortage crisis on a global level, starting with 3rd world countries that are not able to access the same degree of produce as 1st world countries. From there, we hope to expand world wide and grow whole, organic foods at an international level. We hope that in the year 2100, every family will be able to enjoy a healthy, chemical free meal at their tables.
